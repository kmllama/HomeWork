				<p>London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history stretching back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’ clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations. Across the Thames River, the London Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, and the entire city.
				Sir Christopher Wren’s 17th-century St. Paul’s Cathedral towers above ‘The City’, where London’s global Stock Exchange conducts its business. Royal sites include Buckingham Palace, housing the monarch's main residence and offices, and the Tower of London, a former prison that’s home to the Crown Jewels. The British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern explore local and international history and art. West End theatres present classic and cutting-edge drama. Covent Garden, Soho and Spitalfields Market are popular dining and shopping areas. Major public spaces include Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath.</p>

				<p>Street art in London
				London has one of the biggest and best collections of uncommissioned street art in the world. Local and international artists have decorated the streets of London with a staggering array of creative works, from miniature bronze statues to painted murals several storeys high.

				One of the most famous street artists to date is the anonymous Banksy, whose distinctive stencil artwork has regularly appeared in London for more than a decade. Some of his art makes a hard-hitting political point, while other works of his are extremely funny; often they are both. Due to his popularity, or unpopularity in some cases, many of the original Banksy pieces are no longer visible in London.

				You can also hunt for unique pieces of street art around north London, search for colourful artworks in Camden or admire the super-cool graffiti-filled Leake Street Tunnel near Waterloo Station – a hidden gem for street-art lovers.</p>
